            <div class="text-body">
                <p class="first-p"><span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is a classic novel written by American author
                    Herman Melville and
                    first published in 1851.
                    The novel tells the story of Captain Ahab’s obsessive quest for revenge against the great white whale,
                    Moby Dick, which had previously maimed him during a whaling voyage. The book delves into themes of fate,
                    obsession, the nature of evil, and man’s relationship with nature.</p>
                <p>The story is narrated by Ishmael, a young man who decides to go to sea as a sailor and escape the
                    landlocked world. He joins the crew of the whaling ship Pequod, captained by the enigmatic and
                    monomaniacal Captain Ahab. On board the ship, Ishmael befriends Queequeg, a harpooner and a cannibal
                    from the South Pacific, who becomes his close companion.</p>
                <h3>Interpretations</h3>
                <p><span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> can sustain numerous, if not seemingly infinite, readings generated
                    by multiple interpretative
                    approaches. One of the most fruitful ways to appreciate the novel’s complexity is through the names that
                    Melville gave to its characters, many of which are shared with figures of the Abrahamic religions. The
                    very first line of <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span>, for instance, identifies Ishmael as the
                    narrator; Ishmael was the
                    illegitimate son of Abraham and was cast away after Isaac was born. There are
                    a number of other Abrahamic names in the book as well, including Ahab—who, according to the Hebrew
                    Bible, was an evil king who led the Israelites into a life of idolatry. Melville’s Ahab is obsessed with
                    Moby Dick, an idol that causes the death of his crew. The ship that saves Ishmael, the Rachel, is named
                    for the mother of Joseph, known for interceding to protect her children. It is Rachel, as depicted in
                    the Book of Jeremiah, who convinced God to end the exile placed upon the Jewish tribes for idolatry. The
                    rescue of Ishmael by the Rachel in <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> can thus be read as his return
                    from an exile caused by his
                    complicity (because he was on the Pequod’s crew) in Ahab’s idolatry of the whale. Melville’s use of
                    these names grants his novel a rich layer of additional meaning.</p>
                <p>While <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> may tell the tale of a hunt for the elusive White Whale,
                    Melville’s most famous work
                    lives up to its reputation as a classic piece of American literature for the ways in which he uses its
                    central plot as a vehicle for exploring the racial, political, and gender dynamics of his era. Captain
                    Ahab’s monomaniacal nature and Moby Dick’s inscrutability both take on different layers of meaning
                    throughout the novel, a flexibility which reflects the text’s overarching theme of unknowability or
                    uncertainty. The novel’s literal conflict is the ongoing struggle between Ahab and Moby Dick that
                    emerges as the captain’s desire to avenge his missing leg continues to fester, but the broader tension
                    that Melville depicts is the fight to impose a single view on a world which is inherently undefinable.
                    He examines this desire to maintain a sense of power through a political lens by contrasting Ahab’s
                    authoritarianism with the democracy of the crew, a racial lens by discussing interpretations of
                    whiteness, and a gendered lens by highlighting his wounded masculinity. All of these approaches
                    challenge the reader to evaluate the power dynamics of 19th century America, and ultimately reveal the
                    consequences of seeing certainty as a virtue.</p>
                <p>The whale itself is perhaps the most striking symbol in <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span>, and
                    interpretations of its meaning
                    range from the Judeo-Christian God to atheism and everything in between. Between the passages of
                    carefully detailed cetology, the epigraphs, and the shift from a hero’s quest narrative to a tragedy,
                    Melville set the stage for purposeful ambiguity. The novel’s ability to produce numerous interpretations
                    is, perhaps, the main reason it is considered one of the greatest American novels.</p>

                        <p>Herman Melville (born Melvill; August 1, 1819 – September 28, 1891) was an American novelist,
                            short story writer, and poet of the American Renaissance period. Among his best-known works are
                            <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> (1851); <span class="italic">Typee</span> (1846), a
                            romanticized account of his experiences in Polynesia; and
                            <span class="italic">Billy Budd, Sailor</span>, a posthumously published novella. At the time of
                            his death, Melville was no
                            longer well known to the public, but the 1919 centennial of his birth was the starting point of
                            a Melville revival. <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> eventually would be considered one of
                            the great American
                            novels.
                        </p>
                        <p>Melville was born in New York City, the third child of a prosperous merchant whose death in 1832
                            left the family in dire financial straits. He took to sea in 1839 as a common sailor on a
                            merchant ship and then on the whaler Acushnet, but he jumped ship in the Marquesas Islands.
                            <span class="italic">Typee</span>, his first book, and its sequel, <span class="italic">Omoo</span> (1847), were travel-adventures based on his
                            encounters with the peoples of the islands. Their success gave him the financial security to
                            marry Elizabeth Shaw, the daughter of the Boston jurist Lemuel Shaw. <span class="italic">Mardi</span> (1849), a
                            romance-adventure and his first book not based on his own experience, was not well received.
                            <span class="italic">Redburn</span> (1849) and <span class="italic">White-Jacket</span> (1850), both tales based on his experience as a well-born young
                            man at sea, were given respectable reviews, but did not sell well enough to support his
                            expanding family.</p>
